web app scrum cards

how to run:
 
  - python3 run.py
  - gui available at '{HOST:PORT}/' url


works:

  - poll with one marks preset


known bugs:

  - with using android->opera browser(desktop user agent) connection doesn't close properly


what I would like to do first:

  - add versioning
  - improve poll results' review
  - clean up python code
  - improve gui for different platforms
